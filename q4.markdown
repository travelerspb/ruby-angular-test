Your answer here â˜º

record: {
    custom_fields: {},
    users_number: 0,
    priority: 0
}

Priority raise check can be implemented in callbacks. Before saving data, a method can iterate all custom fields and
update priority. This is straightforward solution, but not effective in terms of performance and might be hard to maintain
because of implicit login in domain.

I would prefer another method, to move this logic to the business layer and update labels not directly, but using
custom method, like `set_custom_field`.

Actual implementation here should depend on context. Where do we obtain fields to evaluate priority? How many custom fields
could a record contain? What kind of data it might contain?
